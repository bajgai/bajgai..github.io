Hey, Welcome to my blog. I am a software developer from Calgary, Alberta. My interests are machine learning, music nand movies. Here I will be mostly posting tutorials on machine learning. I am new to the field, the posts are more like notes as I learn new concepts. I am sure there will be losts of newbie mistakes and I would love your feed back.
